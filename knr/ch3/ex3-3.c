/*
Exercise 3-3. Write a function expand(s1,s2) that expands shorthand notations like a-z in
the string s1 into the equivalent complete list abc...xyz in s2. Allow for letters of either
case and digits, and be prepared to handle cases like a-b-c and a-z0-9 and -a-z. Arrange
that a leading or trailing - is taken literally.

 What i think:
 - Have a complete set of each uppercase and lowercase in s2 -this is somehow ineffective
