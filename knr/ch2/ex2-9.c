/*Exercise 2-9. In a two's complement number system, x &= (x-1) deletes the rightmost 1-bit
in x. Explain why. Use this observation to write a faster version of bitcount.
--- i need to review number system - what does 1 complement and two complement look like -----the expression x&= (x-1) makes sense but i need a deeper understanding of the 1 and 2 complements
