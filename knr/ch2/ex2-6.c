/*
Exercise 2-6. Write a function setbits(x,p,n,y) that returns x with the n bits that begin at
position p set to the rightmost n bits of y, leaving the other bits unchanged.

pseudocode:
    1. So its like you are picking bits in certain positions of a number x and then placing them in the number y right most bits
    2. Extract the bits in x that you want to place in y
        -Right shift the bits to right most positions of x
        - Mask off the extra unwanted bits that were on the left of our most right bit of interest
            - have all bits to be ones
            - left shift it in a magnitude corrsponding to the number of bits we are interested in
    3. Then place the left bits of y that are to the left after n first bits to x
        - Using or

   //~0 << n - Shifts 1 n times to create a mask with n zeroes at the rightmost end = 11111000
   // ~ inverts the bit mask to have a bit mask that clears all other bits except the ones under the bits of interest positions: ie positions with ones,,ie 00000111

   //(1 << n) shifts 1 to the left to create a mask that looks like.. 00001000
   // subtracting one yields 00000111
   //inverting this yields 11111000 - this is the mask that clears the righmost bit positions in x
